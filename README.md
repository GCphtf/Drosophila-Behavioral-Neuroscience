# Drosophila-Cognitive-Neuroscience
This is the study note of Yu Geng (GC). 

The behaviors are recorded and analyzed in the [Behaviors](https://github.com/GCphtf/Drosophila-Behavioral-Neuroscience/tree/main/Behaviors) folder. Likewise, the [Brain_areas](https://github.com/GCphtf/Drosophila-Behavioral-Neuroscience/tree/main/Brain_Areas) folder records information about brain areas, and the [Neurons](https://github.com/GCphtf/Drosophila-Behavioral-Neuroscience/tree/main/Neurons) folder contain notes about neurons. The sources of the information are recorded in [References_Unformal](https://github.com/GCphtf/Drosophila-Behavioral-Neuroscience/tree/main/References_Unformal).
